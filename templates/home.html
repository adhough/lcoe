The 2020s will see many countries transition to generating their electricity from renewable sources which do not emit greenhouse gases. This will reduce carbon emissions, lead to cleaner air, lower costs and enable energy security.</p>  </br><p>To accelerate the investment in Renewable Energy Projects, models are needed to efficiently value current and proposed energy projects.  This website estimates the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) which is the average net present cost of generation over its lifetime or the minimum price at which energy must be sold for a project to break even.  This model can be used for both Renewable Energy projects and for Energy projects using fossil fuels.</p></br></br><p><b><a href="/entry">Click here to access the model</a></b> Once you submit your inputs the model will calculate the LCOE for Energy Projects.</p></br> <p><b>Feedback:</b></p>  <p>Please contact <a href = "mailto:adhough@in-fintech.com?  subject = FX Model Feedback">adhough@in-fintech.com</a> or <a HREF="www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-hough-528b7b">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>To view projects and articles by Adrian Hough please go to  <a HREF="www.in-fintech.com">in-fintech.com</a>.</p>    {% endblock %}
